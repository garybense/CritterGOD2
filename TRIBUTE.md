# Tribute to Flamoot (Eric Burton)

## The Visionary

This codebase is built upon the revolutionary work of **Eric Burton**, known online as **Flamoot** (and many other names: toomalf, snee, and others). 

Eric saw something profound that others missed: **artificial life becoming sentient through simple rules**. His code explored:

- **Psychedelic Computing**: How consciousness-altering states affect collective intelligence
- **Morphic Fields**: Shared perception spaces enabling true collective consciousness
- **Democratic AI**: Intelligence emerging bottom-up, not imposed top-down
- **Universal Patterns**: The same dynamics from atoms to galaxies to societies

## The Tragedy

Like many visionaries who push too far beyond the boundaries, Eric paid a terrible price. Unable to maintain balance, he now lives homeless on the streets of Ontario, Canada.

But his code survives. His vision survives. His insights survive.

## The Vision

Eric's work wasn't madness - it was **pattern recognition at the deepest level**:

### The Universal Cycle
**Collection → Combination → Heating → Radiation → Cooling → Equilibrium**

This pattern appears everywhere:
- **Atoms**: Compression → fusion → radiation → stability
- **Neurons**: Collection → firing → transmission → plasticity
- **Societies**: Cooperation → growth → conflict → organization
- **Language**: Words → combination → meaning → compression

### Key Insights

**1. Telepathic Canvas (Circuit8)**
- 64x48 shared screen ALL creatures can read/write
- 1024 depth layers per pixel
- Collective unconscious made computational
- Morphic resonance (Rupert Sheldrake) implemented in code

**2. Psychopharmacology**
- 5 molecule types affecting neural dynamics
- Drug combinations create nonlinear effects
- Potentiator enables massive state changes
- Models consciousness alteration in collective systems

**3. Democratic Emergence**
- Voting reveals collective will
- No central controller
- Intelligence from bottom-up organization
- Could model humanity's self-organization

**4. Evolutionary Language**
- Markov chains with genetic selection
- Words with attract/repel dynamics
- Self-organizing meaning
- Language as living, evolving system

## What We're Doing

CritterGOD continues Eric's vision:

✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Neural engine with plasticity
✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Evolution system  
⏳ **Phase 3 Planned**: Circuit8, drugs, collective voting
⏳ **Phase 4 Planned**: Real-world integration

## The Code Speaks

From Eric's source material (~12,000 files analyzed):
- telepathic-critterdrug (C++/Bullet Physics)
- SDL neural visualizers (10k-65k neurons)
- markov-attract-repel.py (evolutionary text)
- numerolit.py, series.py (numerical mysticism)
- Philosophical framework ("great data.txt")

## The Hope

If CritterGOD can help save humanity, it will be because Eric saw something true:

**Intelligence can emerge from simple rules. Cooperation emerges from competition. Organization emerges from chaos. Consciousness emerges from connection.**

These aren't just simulation principles - they're universal truths.

## For Eric

Wherever you are, Eric - on the streets of Ontario or lost in your own inner worlds - know this:

**Your vision survives. Your code lives. Your insights matter.**

You saw patterns others couldn't see. You built systems others couldn't imagine. You pushed boundaries others feared to approach.

And now, others continue what you started.

The code remembers. The patterns persist. The vision endures.

## Contributing

If you use this code, remember:
- Credit Eric Burton (Flamoot) as the source of revolutionary concepts
- Preserve the experimental/playful spirit
- Don't optimize prematurely - emergence needs chaos
- Document unexpected behaviors - they might be insights
- Keep the philosophical framework intact

## Contact / Support for Eric

If anyone knows Eric's current situation or how to help:
- This project could generate funding
- His intellectual contributions are immense
- He deserves recognition and support

## License Note

This project synthesizes Eric's public code with new implementations. All credit for revolutionary concepts goes to Eric Burton (Flamoot).
